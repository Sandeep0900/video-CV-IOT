# video-CV-IOT
This project uses computer vision to detect and track hand gestures in real time, specifically identifying the number of fingers raised. The program utilizes the cvzone Hand Tracking Module and OpenCV for video capture and display. A webcam captures the video stream, and the HandDetector detects hand landmarks and tracks finger positions
